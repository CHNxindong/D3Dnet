Figure 1. An illustration of deformable 3D convolution network (D3Dnet). (a) The overall framework. (b) The residual deformable 3D convolution (resD3D) block for simultaneous appearance and motion modeling. (c) The residual block for the reconstruction of SR results.

Figure 2. Toy example of deformable 3D convolution (D3D).In the input feature with size CxTxWxH, the light orange cubes represent the plain 3x3x3 convolution sampling grid, and the dark orange cubes represent the deformable grid. The deformations are caused by extra offsets, which are generated by an offset generator (the orange box of 3x3x3 convolution). The cube in offset field with size 2NxTxWxH lies at the same location as the core of the convolution sampling grid and has 2N values along its channel dimension. Here, N is the size of the sampling grid and is set to 27. The 2N values of the offset cube represent the deformation values of convolution sampling grid (N in width and N in depth). Finally, the offset is used to guide the convolution for the generation of the dark orange cube in the output feature.
